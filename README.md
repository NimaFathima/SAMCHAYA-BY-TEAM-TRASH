### Project Description

**Samchaya** (from *Samsaaram* for conversation and *Chaya* for tea) is an AIoT smart coaster that gives your beverage a voice. It senses your drink's status and uses Generative AI to speak unique, context-aware dialogues in a natural voice, preventing the tragedy of forgotten, cold tea.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)

We are tackling the silent epidemic known as **Cold Chaya Syndrome (CCS)**. Every day, millions of productive hours are lost and countless souls are disheartened when a perfectly good cup of tea or coffee goes cold, forgotten amidst the chaos of work. This first-world problem leads to decreased morale and the existential dread of a lukewarm sip.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)

The **Samchaya** coaster is a hyper-intelligent, slightly judgmental beverage companion. It doesn't just buzz or blink; it *talks*. Using an ESP8266 brain and an array of sensors, it monitors your drink and your level of neglect, delivering timely (and often sarcastic) vocal interventions to save you from the horror of CCS.

**Caption:** Architecture diagram showing the data flow from the ESP8266 coaster, across the Wi-Fi network to the Flask server, which then communicates with Google's AI & TTS APIs before playing the final audio on the laptop.

#### For Hardware:

**Schematic & Circuit**

**Caption:** A photo of the final circuit on the breadboard, showing the connections between the NodeMCU ESP8266, DHT11 sensor, and IR sensor.

**Build Photos**

**Caption:** All the hardware components used in the project laid out: NodeMCU ESP8266, DHT11, IR Sensor, Breadboard, and Jumper Wires.

### Project Demo

**Video**

`[Add your YouTube or Google Drive link to the demo video here]`
**Caption:** A short video demonstrating the full end-to-end functionality: a cup is placed on the coaster, the logs appear on the screens, and the unique AI-generated audio is played from the laptop's speakers.

### Team Contributions

  * **`SAKHIL N MAJU`**: Responsible for the entire hardware assembly, wiring the ESP8266 and sensors, and writing the C++/Arduino firmware to read sensor data and trigger the backend over Wi-Fi.
  * **`NIMA FATHIMA`**: Responsible for setting up the Python backend, creating the Flask server, integrating with Google Gemini and Text-to-Speech APIs, and managing the audio playback with Pygame.
