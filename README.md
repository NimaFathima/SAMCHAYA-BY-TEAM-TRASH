### Project Description

**Samchaya** (from *Samsaaram* for conversation and *Chaya* for tea) is an AIoT smart coaster that gives your beverage a voice. It senses your drink's status and uses Generative AI to speak unique, context-aware dialogues in a natural voice, preventing the tragedy of forgotten, cold tea.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)

We are tackling the silent epidemic known as **Cold Chaya Syndrome (CCS)**. Every day, millions of productive hours are lost and countless souls are disheartened when a perfectly good cup of tea or coffee goes cold, forgotten amidst the chaos of work. This first-world problem leads to decreased morale and the existential dread of a lukewarm sip.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)

The **Samchaya** coaster is a hyper-intelligent, slightly judgmental beverage companion. It doesn't just buzz or blink; it *talks*. Using an ESP8266 brain and an array of sensors, it monitors your drink and your level of neglect, delivering timely (and often sarcastic) vocal interventions to save you from the horror of CCS.
